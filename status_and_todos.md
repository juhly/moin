# In the paper folder are currently these analyses

- use data from Harran plain as well as Wagrien
- create network of sites (based on graphs: Delaunay, Gabriel Graph, ..)
- calculate centrality parameters based on network
- use centrality parameter (degree) as "attractiveness" (Wj parameter).
- Oi parameter is for all the same
- some graphs are created

# Formulate some research questions
Question: Is the network location mirrored in the size of a settlement? This can be analyzed because the singly-constrained gravity model (also in the entropy maximization case) can be seen as a location model. The more flows that are attracted, the more important is a site
