# Ideas to be put in analyses

- use data from Harran plain
- use size of settlements
- create network of sites 
- calculate centrality parameters based on network
- use centrality parameter as "attractiveness"
- use size as "Oi" parameter
- create nice graphs and maps based on that. 

Question: Is the network location mirrored in the size of a settlement? This can be analyzed because the singly-constrained gravity model (also in the entropy maximization case) can be seen as a location model. The more flows that are attracted, the more important is a site
